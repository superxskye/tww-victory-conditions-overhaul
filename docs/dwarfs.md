	* Defeat Archaon

### Analysis

For both victories, World Tour and Rockin' All Over The World should be deleted, as they do not feel natural.

For the short victory, no grudge should be passed, as this is the faction of Thorgrim Grudgebearer. Also, Chaos Invasion 
should not be something forced, as the played could finish the campaign before the appearance of Archaon.

For the long victory, the grudges against Greenskins and High Elves should not be passed. Skaven should neither be 
allowed in the Old World nor in the Badlands.
